a='''In 65 years of formal diplomatic relations, Nepal and China have advanced their ties from the initial minimum interaction to strategic level cooperation at present. While Chinese interests in Nepal lie in safeguarding its interests in Tibet and minimising India’s presence in Nepal to expand its regional presence for market and defence purposes, Nepal looks at China as a strong point in pushing India for its benefits. Meanwhile, Nepal’s newfound love for China in recent years poses a significant challenge to Nepal’s political autonomy and territorial integrity. Therefore, Nepal must engage with China carefully considering Beijing’s expansionist outlook, and balance ties with India to counter any potential threats from China in future. Also, Nepal-China cooperation continues to overshadow India’s goodwill in Nepal due to lack of timely changes in the traditional ties. Hence, India should revisit its Nepal policy based on stronger economic and development-oriented cooperation. The present paper critically analyses various dimensions of Nepal-China relations and their impact on India.'''
